# Dino-game

This is my 1st web-development project. I  created this game using html canvas. Throughout the project, I created the game loop, add images onto the canvas, add click handlers to allow the dinosaur to jump, randomly generate cactuses or cacti and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the dinosaur and each cactus, and add a running score and finally display the
game over and score.
